    <p4> Your coach</p4>
    <p3>My name is Ivona. I was born in Veles and now I live in Skopje, where I go to college. I am student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies in third year at direction TKII. 
      Some of my favourite things to do are read books, listen to music, and of course to solve tasks at college. These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily. Also my life moto is to become a electrical engineer. I am a certified Pilates instructor, a leading classical Pilates educator. I have many years of study experience. Pilates is the most complete and effective workout youâ€™ll experience. Its benefits are many. One of the most valuable benefits is that it allows you to achieve top physical fitness, mental strength and encourage you to achieve rapid weight loss. I instruct Pilates, privates and duets.Follow me for more :) (lie :P)</p3>
